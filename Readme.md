##MyDotNetBin

MyDotNetBin is a collection of some of the various classes, methods and controls I have found, developed or modified throughout my experiences with the .NET framework, and especially WPF.

I have tried to include demos for everything in the _Demo_ project. Please feel free to modify, use or steal anything you want to.
